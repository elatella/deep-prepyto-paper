## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Cryo-electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) has the potential to reveal cell structure down to atomic resolution.
Nevertheless, cellular cryo-ET data is often highly complex, and visualization, as well as quantification, of subcellular structures require image segmentation.
Due to a relatively high level of noise and anisotropic resolution in cryo-ET data, automatic segmentation based on classical computer vision approaches usually does not perform satisfactorily.
For this reason, cryo-ET researchers have mostly performed manual segmentation.

Communication between neurons relies on neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis.
Recruitment of SVs to the plasma membrane is an important means of regulating exocytosis and is influenced by interactions between SVs.
Cryo-ET study of the spatial organization of SVs and of their interconnections allows a better understanding of the mechanisms of exocytosis regulation.
Extremely accurate SV segmentation is a prerequisite to obtaining a faithful representation of SVs state of connectivity.
Hundreds to thousands of SVs are present in a typical synapse, and their manual segmentation is a time-consuming exercise, which has been recognized as a bottleneck by the community.

Several attempts to automate vesicle segmentation by classical computer vision or machine learning algorithms have not yielded very robust results.
We addressed this problem by designing a workflow consisting of a U-Net convolutional network followed by post-processing steps.
This combination yields highly accurate results.
Furthermore, we provide an interactive tool for accurately segmenting spherical vesicles in a fraction of the time required by available manual segmentation methods.
This tool can be used to segment vesicles that were missed by the fully automatic procedure or to quickly segment a handful of vesicles while bypassing the fully automatic procedure.
Our pipeline can in principle be used to segment any spherical vesicle in any cell type as well as extracellular vesicles.
